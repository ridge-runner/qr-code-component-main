## My Process
Focused on using Flex Box in the positioning of the component. Vanilla CSS was used.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML 5 markup (where possible)
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

1. I got a better grasp on layout methods by combining Flex.
2. Sometimes, things are left out of the desgin system docs and you have to either improvise (or call someone.)
 
 ### Continued Development
 1. Keep working on Grid and Flex layouts.
 2. Use modern best practices like @layer and modular layouts.

 ### Useful Resources

 - [Kevin Powell's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - The guy's channel is a great resource for all things CSS.
 - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - for obvious reasons. Now better since they've started including demos like W3 Schools.
